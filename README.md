### The prediction system applies modern machine learning technologies together with big data techniques for credit card evaluations. The model analyzes large datasets and generates new features using CatBoost and LightGBM and HistGradientBoosting with PySpark to achieve high prediction speeds on AER Credit Card Data. For predictive performance enhancement, I implemented FT-transformers based on transformer-based models.
